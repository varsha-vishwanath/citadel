# Zahard's Welcome

## Challenge Description

The base of Citadel rises before you, its great doors sealed with fractured steel and dead circuitry. Faded corporate protocols still hum in the lock, relics of the world that fell.

Those who came before tried to climb but all failed. Their echoes linger as fragments of voices, reminders of broken attempts to free humanity. Now you have chosen to take their place. You will be the one to scale the Citadel and finish what they could not.

The voices of the fallen whisper through the static: "The path begins in the gathering place. There, candidates are chosen". Here is your invitation.

Step into the gathering place where all climbers are briefed before the ascent.

## Solve

**Flag:** `citadel{7h3_c174d3l_b3ck0n5}`

This challenge was a nice welcome. It said to go where "all climbers were briefed before the ascent" and I remembered that all participants were asked to join the discord server. I checked the official channels and found the flag hiding at the top of the rules section.



# The Social Network

## Challenge Description
ðŸ—¼OSINT pt1: The ascent begins. The first floor is not metal or binaries but of memory. Among the echoes, one voice lingers, of an early climber. He was among the earliest to challenge the Citadel, and though he failed, his traces remain scattered across the ruins of the old world.

It is said that the key to the next floor can be found by tracing the socials of this legendary climber.

Start by checking out citadweller on Instagram.

## Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{17_1s_jus7_7h3_b3g1nn1ng}`

This challenge was a lot of fun. I thought it was a nice way to ease into the ctf. The description gave me the first instruction which was to stalk the citadweller on instagram. After finding the account, I noticed the highlight on the page and opened it to find the first part of the flag and another instruction. That clue led me to the citadweller's X account which gave me the second part of the flag.

## New Learnings
I learned what OSINT meant (Open source intelligence) and was able to get a small taste of what an OSINT challenge would be like.



# track 8

## Challenge Description
an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it

When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchikoâ€™s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.
